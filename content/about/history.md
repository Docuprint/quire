## The Background

[Getty](https://www.getty.edu/) has preserved and presented the world’s artistic legacy through the publication and dissemination of research in printed books and journals for over sixty years. Over the last two decades, the internet has offered us a platform to share at a scale and with a reach far greater than anything before possible. Getty has shared hundreds of thousands of open-content images, connected with and inspired individuals around the globe through social networks and blogs, and disseminated vital tools like the [Getty Vocabularies](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/) and [Arches](https://www.archesproject.org/) to the benefit of the field.

However, while important art historical research and scholarly communication are increasingly taking place in the digital sphere, the field still lacks reliable, sustainable tools for presenting long-form scholarship online. Moreover, the tools that do exist often require potentially costly long-term maintenance and don’t support visually rich narratives. They fall short of our institutional ambition to create globally accessible publications across devices and borders, a key advantage of digital publication. The field needs sustainable, dynamic ways to publish critical research and scholarship online, and Getty is uniquely positioned to advance this effort.

In 2009, the Getty Foundation launched a program called the [Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI)](http://www.oscitoolkit.org/) to support eight museums’ efforts to publish their collection catalogues online.  Collection catalogues, having been traditionally published in print, were costly to produce, offered relatively limited access (mostly through research libraries that would collect them), and were difficult, if not impossible, to update. At the end of the initiative, all eight museums had successfully published one or more collection catalogues online and had plans to do more. OSCI transformed the digital publishing landscape for museums at large and unequivocally established Getty’s leadership in the field. The question was no longer whether museums could publish scholarly content online but rather: *how should they best do it?* However, [notable challenges remained](https://www.getty.edu/publications/osci-report/remaining-challenges/), particularly around the discoverability of the catalogues after publication, and the longevity of the catalogues, both as individual digital objects out in the world and as publication processes internally.

In 2014, [Getty Publications](https://www.getty.edu/publications) began building on OSCI’s successes by investing in full-time digital publishing staff. Their work on digital book projects for Getty was guided by three fundamental challenges that had been previously identified by the Getty Foundation and the OSCI grantees:

- Increasing discoverability of online publications
- Ensuring the longevity of online content
- Increasing the sustainability of the online publishing process.

To address these challenges, the team began developing Quire.

## The Development of Quire

Quire is a multiformat publishing tool that is structured around [static site generation](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/). Static site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the one under the hood in Quire, allow users to keep content in plain text. This keeps the complexity of building the site at the point of publication, rather than relying on ongoing build processes through a server that needs to be continually maintained. We could also use the static site generator (hooked together with some other tools) to put that plain text content into formats other than online sites. Formats like PDF, e-book and even print would allow the publication to live where other publications live (bookstores, Amazon, Google Books, the Library of Congress, WorldCat) and thereby dramatically improve its discoverability and its archival longevity.

Getty has successfully published over [ten Quire publications](https://www.getty.edu/publications/digital/digitalpubs.html) over the last four years, which have served as prototypes for the development of Quire.

Some examples of Getty publications that utilized Quire (through various stages of its development) include:

2016

[Roman Mosaics](https://www.getty.edu/publications/romanmosaics/)

[Introduction to Metadata, Third Edition](https://www.getty.edu/publications/intrometadata/)

[Ancient Terracottas](https://www.getty.edu/publications/terracottas/)

2017

[Artistry in Bronze](https://www.getty.edu/publications/artistryinbronze/index.html)

[Ancient Lamps](https://www.getty.edu/publications/ancientlamps/)

2018

[Keep it Moving](https://www.getty.edu/publications/keepitmoving/)

2019

[Ancient Ambers](https://www.getty.edu/publications/ambers/)

[Values in Heritage Management](https://www.getty.edu/publications/heritagemanagement/)

After several years of development and testing, Quire is at a point where a typical online publication such as a collection catalogue or a symposium proceedings volume can be produced by publication editors and content producers with minimal technical intervention.

While Getty originally developed Quire in response to its own publishing needs, it quickly became apparent that many other institutions and individuals sought a similar solution for the long-term sustainability and increased discoverability of their publications. In 2018, the decision was made to move Quire towards an open-source model and [enable beta access](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckvPWWyyfZJko6JTqf3slcXCV8vcCgQjAzoW4MfHEt9hDuxQ/viewform). By open-sourcing Quire and supporting its ongoing use in the field, other institutions will be able to leverage the work we’ve done (and continue to do) to publish their content online at low cost and with very little ongoing maintenance.

## An Open-Source Future

Through our beta program, we continue to welcome new users who will not only utilize Quire to create beautiful publications but also meaningfully contribute to its growth and health as a publishing tool. As Quire continues to evolve, our goal is to launch as fully open source by 2022. A community-supported model would enable Quire to remain free to use and would ensure a long lifespan outside of Getty.
