## The Background

[The Getty](https://www.getty.edu/) has preserved and presented the world’s artistic legacy through the publication and dissemination of research in printed books and journals for over sixty years. Over the last two decades, the internet has offered us a platform to share at a scale and with a reach far greater than anything before possible. The Getty has shared hundreds of thousands of open-content images, connected with and inspired individuals around the globe through social networks and blogs, and disseminated vital tools like the [Getty Vocabularies](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/) and [Arches](https://www.archesproject.org/) to the benefit of the field.

However, while important art historical research and scholarly communication is increasingly taking place in the digital sphere, the field still lacks reliable, sustainable tools for presenting long-form scholarship online. Moreover, the tools that do exist often require potentially costly long-term maintenance, don’t support visually rich narratives, and fall short of our institutional ambition to create publications that are globally accessible across devices and borders, a key advantage of digital publication. The field needs sustainable, dynamic ways to publish critical research and scholarship online and the Getty is uniquely positioned to advance this effort.

In 2009, the Getty Foundation launched a program called the [Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI)](http://www.oscitoolkit.org/) to support eight museums’ efforts to publish their collection catalogues online. Having traditionally been published in print, collection catalogues were costly to produce, offered relatively little access (mostly through research libraries that would collect them), and were difficult, if not impossible, to update. At the end of the initiative, all eight museums had successfully published one or more collection catalogues online and had plans to do more. OSCI transformed the digital publishing landscape for museums at large and unequivocally established the Getty’s leadership in the field. The question was no longer whether museums could publish scholarly content online but rather: how should they best do it? However, some notable challenges remained, particularly around the discoverability of the catalogues after publication, and the longevity of the catalogues, both as individual digital objects out in the world and as publication processes internally.

In 2014, [Getty Publications](https://www.getty.edu/publications) began building on OSCI’s successes by investing in full-time digital publishing staff. Their work on digital book projects for the Getty was guided by three fundamental challenges that had been previously identified by the Getty Foundation and the OSCI grantees: increasing discoverability of online publications, ensuring the longevity of online content, and increasing the sustainability of the online publishing process. To address these challenges the team developed Quire.

## The Development of Quire

Quire is a multiformat publishing tool that is structured around static site generation. Static site generators like [Hugo](https://hugo.io/), the one under the hood in Quire, allows users to keep content in plain text, and keep the complexity of building the site at the point of publication, rather than relying on ongoing build processes through a server that would need to be continually maintained. We could also use the static site generator (hooked together with some other tools) to put that plain text content into formats other than online sites. Formats like PDF, e-book and even print, that would allow the publication to live where other publications live (bookstores, Amazon, Google Books, the Library of Congress, WorldCat) and thereby dramatically improve its discoverability and its archival longevity.

The Getty has successfully published [X Quire publications](https://www.getty.edu/publications/digital/digitalpubs.html) over the last X years, which have served as prototypes for the development of Quire. They’ve allowed us to test and refine the methodologies and the software used. After several years of development and testing, we are at a point where a typical online publication such as a collection catalogue or a symposium proceedings volume can be produced by publication editors and content producers with minimal technical intervention.

While the Getty originally developed Quire in response to its own publishing needs, it quickly became apparent that many other institutions and individuals were seeking a similar solution for the long-term sustainability and increased discoverability of their publications. In 2018, the decision was made to move Quire towards an open-source model and [enable beta access](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckvPWWyyfZJko6JTqf3slcXCV8vcCgQjAzoW4MfHEt9hDuxQ/viewform). By open-sourcing Quire and supporting its ongoing use in the field, other institutions will be able to leverage the work we’ve done (and continue to do) to publish their content online at low cost and with very little ongoing maintenance.

## An Open-Source Future

Through our beta program, we continue to welcome new users who will not only utilize Quire to create beautiful publications but who will also meaningfully contribute to its growth and health as a publishing tool. As Quire continues to evolve, our goal is to launch as fully open-source by 2022. A community-supported model would enable Quire to remain free to use and would ensure a long lifespan outside of the Getty.
