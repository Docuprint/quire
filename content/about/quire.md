## What Is Quire?

Created by Getty, Quire is a modern digital publishing tool that empowers people to create scholarly, visually rich publications in a variety of formats, including online, ebook, and print.

Quire offers an elegant and cost-friendly publishing solution.  No matter the size or scale, an institution that publishes with Quire isn’t locked into proprietary software or a long-term technology choice, nor is it required to have staff with highly advanced technical skills. Quire was designed with its users in mind, from museums, publishers, and academics, to designers, developers, and the plain old digitally curious.

Quire is flexible and feature-rich. It can be used in its most basic configuration or can be heavily customized. It is adaptable for an endless number of use cases, from collection catalogues and online exhibitions to digital pamphlets, reports, and journal articles.

Quire is designed to ensure that digital books and their content are not only as beautiful as the print books we know and love but are equally as enduring. Optimized for discoverability and longevity, Quire enables more robust preservation and distribution of works in a simplified and accessible format. [Learn how Quire works.](#)

At a time when digital initiatives are more vital than ever, Quire offers an innovative and sustainable publishing solution that is affordable, flexible, discoverable, and enduring.

## How Does It Work?

{{< q-figure id="quire_demo" >}}

At the heart of Quire is static site generation. Static site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the one under the hood in Quire, allow users to keep content in plain text with very simple human-readable markup. This keeps the complexity of building the site at the point of publication, rather than relying on ongoing build processes through a server that needs to be continually maintained. Unlike websites with short lifespans, even if certain technology goes obsolete, Quire files will continue to be readable. The static site generator also enables the conversion of plain text content into formats other than online sites, including PDF, e-book, and even print.

## Why Open Source?

Open source is a way of developing software where the source code is free and available for others to use and adapt. Open-source software relies on both transparency and an engaged community of users. The community works together to both use and contribute to the development of the software and its code.

For the past four years, Getty has been utilizing Quire to advance its internal publishing needs. This work has enabled us to test and refine the software. By open-sourcing Quire and supporting its ongoing use in the field, other institutions can leverage the Getty's work to help others publish online at low cost and with very little ongoing maintenance.

Through the Quire beta program, new users are welcomed and encouraged to not only utilize Quire to create beautiful publications but also meaningfully contribute to its growth and health as a publishing tool. As Quire continues to evolve, our goal is to launch as fully open source by 2022. A community-supported model would enable Quire to remain free to use and would ensure a long lifespan beyond Getty.
