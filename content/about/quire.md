## About

Quire is a multiformat publishing tool created by Getty. As an open-source framework, Quire provides a cost-friendly alternative to digital publishing that is inclusive of a variety of features and customizations allowing for the realization of projects in a user-friendly manner. Quire enables greater preservation and digital distribution of works in a simplified format that lends itself to increased longevity and discoverability.

Quire uniquely builds upon the traditions and infrastructures of book publishing and Getty’s expertise in the field, taking essential attributes of print publishing and adopting them for digital publication. By combining the dynamics and interactivity of the web with the imprimatur and stability of print, Quire is designed to ensure that new digital books and their content last as long as the print books we rely on today.

No matter the size or scale of its publishing operation, an institution that publishes a Quire book isn’t locking itself into a long-term technology choice, nor is it required to have staff with highly advanced technical skills to do so. Quire offers a sustainable way to publish work online in a way that is enduring, discoverable, beautiful, and accessible.

## How it Works

### Static-Website Generation

At the heart of Quire is static website generation, which enables Quire publications to enjoy long lifespans without the threat of obsolute technology.

In traditional website publishing, a content management system (CMS) is connected to collections and image databases (1) and set up on a server (2). The CMS is used to create the website, and once the website is published, the CMS rebuilds the site pages each time they are loaded by a user (3). Thus, the CMS must be kept running for the lifetime of the publication.

In static-site publishing, the CMS is just software and a folder of files on your, the publisher’s, computer (1) that are used to build the site. The site files are then uploaded to the server (2), and users (3) access them directly. You only need to run the site software and upload new files if you want to make updates to the publication.

And yet, despite the name, static sites can be as dynamic and interactive as you want them to be, thanks to the full support of the complete web platform (HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript). Zoomable and rotating images, interactive maps, and embedded glossaries are just a few of the features that can be included.
