Quire is a multiformat publishing tool created by Getty. As an open-source framework, Quire provides a cost-friendly alternative to digital publishing that is inclusive of a variety of features and customizations allowing for the realization of projects in a user-friendly manner. Quire enables greater preservation and digital distribution of works in a simplified format that lends itself to increased longevity and discoverability.

Quire uniquely builds upon the traditions and infrastructures of book publishing and Getty’s expertise in the field, taking essential attributes of print publishing and adopting them for digital publication. By combining the dynamics and interactivity of the web with the imprimatur and stability of print, Quire is designed to ensure that new digital books and their content last as long as the print books we rely on today.

No matter the size or scale of its publishing operation, an institution that publishes a Quire book isn’t locking itself into a long-term technology choice, nor is it required to have staff with highly advanced technical skills to do so. Quire offers a sustainable way to publish work online in a way that is enduring, discoverable, beautiful, and accessible.
