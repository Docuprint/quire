## Why Open Source?

Getty is working towards launching Quire as a fully open-source publishing platform by 2021. For the past four years, Getty has been utilizing Quire to publish over 10 born-digital publications. This work has enabled us to test and refine the methodologies and the software. By open-sourcing Quire and supporting its ongoing use in the field, other institutions will be able to leverage the Getty's work to help others publish their content online at low cost and with very little ongoing maintenance. Open-sourcing Quire will enable the publishing tool to thrive within a community-supported model and, therefore, enjoy a long lifespan beyond Getty's walls.

### What Does Open Source Mean?

Open source is a way of developing software where the source code is free and available for others to use and adapt. Open-source software development relies on both transparency and an engaged community of users. The community works together to both use and contribute to the development of the software and its code.
