## About

The Quire community is diverse, scholarly, and digitally curious. Our users frequently work at universities, libraries, and museums. They are publishing professionals, developers, academics, curators, students, and artists. The Quire community is open and accepting of all.

## Why Open Source?

By open-sourcing Quire and supporting its ongoing use in the field, other institutions will be able to leverage the work weâ€™ve done (and continue to do) at the Getty to help others publish their content online at low cost and with very little ongoing maintenance.
