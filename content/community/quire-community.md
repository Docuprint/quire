## About

The Quire community is open, accepting, and accessible to all. We support one another, share knowledge and expertise, and help fellow members solve problems. The Quire community believes in the mission of open-source publishing.  

Quire users come from diverse backgrounds and produce a broad spectrum of publication types. Our users are both content creators and developers. They are publishing professionals, scholars, curators, students, artists, and anyone interested in digital publishing solutions.

If you are interested in joining the community or just curious to learn more, we recommend checking out our **[Forum](https://quire/getty.edu/community/forum)**. We encourage you to browse topics and ask questions to ensure that Quire is the right fit for you or your institution.

## Why open source?

Getty is working towards the goal of launching Quire as a fully open-source publishing platform by 2021. For the past four years, Getty has been utilizing Quire to publish over X born-digital publications. This work has enabled us to test and refine the methodologies and the software. By open-sourcing Quire and supporting its ongoing use in the field, other institutions will be able to leverage the Getty's work to help others publish their content online at low cost and with very little ongoing maintenance. Open-sourcing Quire will enable the publishing tool to thrive within a community-supported model and, therefore, enjoy a long lifespan beyond Getty's walls.

### What does open source mean?

Open source is a way of developing software where the source code is free and available for others to use and adapt. Open-source software development relies on both transparency and an engaged community of users. The community works together to both use and contribute to the development of the software and its code.
