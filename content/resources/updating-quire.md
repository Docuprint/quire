## Updating the CLI

Delete the `quire-cli` folder you originally started with, which should be in your main user directory.

In your command line shell,

```
git clone https://github.com/gettypubs/quire-cli.git
```

You may asked to enter your GitHub username and password. When complete, install the CLI by copying and pasting the following commands into your Terminal and pressing enter.

```
cd quire-cli
npm install -g
```

When complete, type `quire --version` to confirm proper installation. It should return a version number, otherwise, if it says `command not found`, the Quire CLI has not been properly installed.
