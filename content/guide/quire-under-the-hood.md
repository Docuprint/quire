> Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website. Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for metadata, and you can run Hugo from any directory. This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you donâ€™t have a privileged account.

Quire makes use of Hugo via the npm package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hugo-bin"/>`hugo-bin`</a>

Quire uses hugo's command line interface(cli), templating system and http server. to create a way to preview your site while editig the front end code, build a static html site and aids Prince XML to create a PDF of your publication you are building.
