Created by [Getty](https://www.getty.edu), Quire is a modern, multiformat publishing framework designed to create books as authoritative and enduring as print, and as vibrant and feature-rich as the web, from a single set of plain text files. All without ever signing-up for an account, paying a fee, or setting up and maintaining a complicated server.
