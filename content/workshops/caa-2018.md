# Open-Source Digital Publishing with Quire

College Art Association

*February 23, 2018, 2â€“3:30pm*

In this workshop, participants will get hands on with Quire, a new open-source digital publishing framework from the Getty, aimed at scholarly and visual publishing needs, and built for publication discoverability and longevity. Quire is built on a static-site generator which allows you to publish in multiple formats (online, pdf, e-book and print), decrease dependencies and long-term maintenance issues, and keep source content in a human-readable format; all while still offering features like interactive maps, deep zoom images, linked citations, audio and video figures, and more. Participants will learn Quire basics including: getting up and running with basic command line tools; converting and editing content in Markdown and YAML (the two plain-text workhorses of the static-site world); the use of shortcodes to add rich content and interactivity; simple theme and style customizations; and publication hosting and distribution options.

This will be a fast-paced, hands-on technology workshop where participants will learn through simple examples that have a broad range of applications. Participants are encouraged to bring their laptops with them. Note that any operating system will work, though we can offer better support for Mac users. Those without laptops will be paired with others to follow along during the workshop. No prior experience is necessary.
